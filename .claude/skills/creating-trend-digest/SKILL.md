# Creating Trend Digest

Generate a personalized daily trend report: fetch trending items from tech
news sources, score them against the user's interest profile, and publish
the digest as one JSON file in the me repo, which builds and deploys the
Astro site at trends.kkhys.me (`apps/trends`). The profile lives in
`~/.claude/trend-digest/` and improves with every piece of feedback
— treat this as a long-running secretary role, not a one-shot report.

User adjustments for this run (may be empty):

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains instructions (e.g. "セキュリティ中心で", "件数少なめ"),
honor them for this run only. Only update the profile when the user asks for a
lasting change or gives feedback.

## Style

Everything you write for the digest — headline, lead, highlight reasons,
summaries — states facts plainly: what the item is, where it trended, what
changed. No recommendations, no calls to action, no addressing the reader
(「〜すべき」「おすすめ」「注目」「チェックしよう」「試す価値あり」の類は
書かない). No emoji.

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch

`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` is this skill's directory; when the variable reaches you
unexpanded, use the directory that holds this SKILL.md.

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch_trends.py" --skill-dir "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}"
```

First run bootstraps `~/.claude/trend-digest/{config.json,profile.md}` from
bundled defaults — if the output says `BOOTSTRAPPED`, tell the user at the end
that the profile was created from defaults and is worth reviewing.

The script fetches all sources in parallel, computes `base_score` (0-100,
engagement percentile × freshness — see `references/scoring.md`), marks
`seen_before` for URLs already shown on previous days, and writes
`runs/<date>/raw.json`. Failed sources appear with `status: "error"` — never
abort the run for them; their note is shown on the site instead.

Sources listed in `disabled_sources` of `~/.claude/trend-digest/config.json`
are left out of `raw.json` entirely and must not appear in the digest. The
default disables `devto` and `hfpapers` (dev.to and Hugging Face Daily
Papers, dropped on 2026-09-05; their fetchers stay in the script, so
re-enabling is a config edit). Runs published before that still contain
them — leave those files alone.

#### Backfilling a past date

When the user asks for a past date ("8/5の分も作って"), add `--date`:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch_trends.py" --skill-dir "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}" --date 2026-08-05
```

Only Hacker News (via the Algolia index) and Hugging Face Daily Papers
(via the API's date filter, but disabled by default) can be queried
historically. The other sources expose no archive and come back `skipped`
with a note, which renders as a notice on the site — carry it through like
any other skipped service. Tell the user up front that a backfilled digest
covers Hacker News only, not all 8 sources.

- Freshness is scored against the end of the target day, so `base_score` is
  comparable to a live run.
- `seen.json` is left untouched — a past date written out of order would
  rewrite "first seen" for URLs later runs already claimed.
- An existing `raw.json` is never overwritten without `--force`, so a
  backfill cannot clobber a full live run by accident.

Everything downstream (scoring, digest, publish) is unchanged: write
`<date>.json` for the target date and let it deploy alongside the rest.

### 2. Score and summarize

Read `~/.claude/trend-digest/profile.md` and the `raw.json` path printed by
the script. For each service, work through its items and produce the display
list (top `items_per_service` per service after filtering):

- **Drop** items matching the profile's 除外テーマ.
- **interest** (1-3 stars) from the profile's 興味テーマ: high match → 3
  stars, mid → 2 stars, weak/none → 1 star. Stars are an annotation only —
  they must not affect the ranking, so the list stays a flat view of what
  actually trended.
- **score** = `base_score` unchanged. Sort descending.
- **category**: short label derived from the profile themes (e.g. "AI/開発",
  "セキュリティ", "キャリア"). Leave empty if nothing fits.
- **title_ja**: natural Japanese translation of the title when the original
  is not Japanese (translate the meaning; keep product/project names and
  established technical terms as-is, e.g. "Show HN: Elevators" →
  "Show HN: エレベーター制御の可視化"). `""` when the title is already
  Japanese. The site shows `title_ja` as the linked title with the original
  beneath it.
- **summary**: 1-2 Japanese sentences (60-120 chars): what it is, plus the
  concrete detail that makes it relevant to the profile. Write from
  title/excerpt/`content` and your own knowledge — do not fetch articles
  yourself.
- **discussion_summary**: only for items whose raw.json entry has a
  `comments` array (the fetch script attaches top comments to the top
  `comments_top_n` items of HN / Lobsters / Reddit / はてなブックマーク —
  with the default of 10 that is every displayed item of those services):
  2-3 short
  Japanese paragraphs, 300-450 chars total, separated by a blank line
  (`\n\n` inside the JSON string; the site renders one `<p>` per paragraph
  in a fold). First paragraph: what the article/story actually is, adding
  context the title alone doesn't carry. Remaining paragraph(s): the main
  points raised in the comments and, when visible, the split of opinion —
  attribute claims to the commenters (「〜という指摘」「〜との報告」), not
  to yourself. Facts only, no editorializing. Items without `comments` get
  `""`.
- **article_summary**: only for items whose raw.json entry has a `content`
  field (the fetch script attaches the article body / README / abstract to
  the top `articles_top_n` items of the sources that have no comment
  fetcher: GitHub Trending / Zenn / Qiita): 2-3 short Japanese paragraphs,
  300-450 chars total, separated by a blank line, summarizing the article
  itself — what it covers, the concrete approach or claims, and any results
  or numbers it reports. Summarize only what `content` actually says; the
  body is clipped, so never guess beyond it. Facts only, same paragraph
  format as discussion_summary. Items without `content` get `""` (an item
  never has both — comment sources get discussion_summary, the rest get
  this). Techmeme items have neither `comments` nor `content` — their
  headline is already the story in condensed form, so both fields stay `""`.

### 3. Write the digest

Compose the digest for the top of the page:

- `headline`: one line capturing today's dominant story or pattern.
- `lead`: 2-3 sentences connecting today's trends across sources.
- `highlights`: 3-5 cross-service picks, each with a one-line `reason`
  stating the observed signal (e.g. appears on multiple services, unusually
  high engagement, direct hit on a high-interest theme). Prefer items
  appearing in multiple services and high-interest matches. Carry the item's
  `title_ja` through (same rule: `""` for Japanese titles).

### 4. Publish

Resolve the site repo: read `site_repo` from
`~/.claude/trend-digest/config.json` (expand `~`). If the key is missing,
use `~/projects/github.com/kkhys/me` and add the key to config.json (Edit)
so the next run reads it. `$REPO` below stands for that path.

Preflight — if any check fails, stop and report what failed plus the manual
recovery step. Never checkout, stash, or force anything:

1. `git -C $REPO ls-files apps/trends/package.json` prints a path
   (repo exists and contains the trends app)
2. `git -C $REPO rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` prints `main`
3. `git -C $REPO status --porcelain -- apps/trends/src/content/runs` is
   empty (dirt elsewhere in the repo is fine — only this file gets committed)
4. `git -C $REPO pull --ff-only` succeeds

Write `$REPO/apps/trends/src/content/runs/<date>.json` in this shape:

```json
{
  "date": "2026-08-08",
  "generated_at": "2026-08-08T09:30:00+09:00",
  "digest": {
    "headline": "...",
    "lead": "...",
    "highlights": [
      {
        "title": "...",
        "title_ja": "...",
        "url": "...",
        "service_label": "Hacker News",
        "reason": "..."
      }
    ]
  },
  "markets": [
    {
      "id": "japan",
      "label": "日本",
      "services": [
        {
          "id": "hatena",
          "label": "はてなブックマーク",
          "status": "ok",
          "note": "",
          "items": [
            {
              "title": "...",
              "title_ja": "",
              "url": "...",
              "comments_url": "...",
              "score": 87,
              "engagement_label": "313 users",
              "category": "AI/開発",
              "interest": 3,
              "summary": "...",
              "discussion_summary": "",
              "article_summary": "",
              "seen_before": false,
              "extra": ""
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "global",
      "label": "グローバル",
      "services": ["... hackernews, lobsters, reddit, github, techmeme ..."]
    }
  ]
}
```

- 2-space indent, UTF-8 without `\uXXXX` escapes, trailing newline. The
  filename must equal the `date` field.
- Every string field is required — write `""` for missing values, never null.
- Carry `status`/`note` from raw.json through unchanged (skipped/error
  services render as a notice). Japan services: hatena, zenn, qiita.
  Global: hackernews, lobsters, reddit, github, techmeme. Sources absent
  from raw.json (disabled ones) stay absent here — never add an empty
  section for them.
- The site's zod schema (`apps/trends/src/content.config.ts`) is strict:
  unknown or retired fields (e.g. `action_note`) fail the build. When the
  schema changes, update it, this JSON example, and the existing files in
  `runs/` together.
- Re-running on the same day overwrites the file. If git shows no diff for
  it after writing, report that the deployed digest is already current and
  stop here.

Then commit → deploy → push, in this order — deploy must succeed before
anything is pushed:

```bash
git -C $REPO add apps/trends/src/content/runs/<date>.json
git -C $REPO commit -m "chore(trends): add digest for <date>"
pnpm -C $REPO deploy:trends
git -C $REPO push origin main
open https://trends.kkhys.me/
```

Use `update digest for <date>` as the message when overwriting. Failure
handling:

- Build fails on a zod error → fix the JSON, `git add` it, then
  `git -C $REPO commit --amend --no-edit` and retry the deploy (max 2
  retries). The commit is not pushed yet, so amending is safe.
- Deploy fails otherwise → retry once. If it still fails, do NOT push; leave
  the commit in place and report the error with the recovery commands
  (`pnpm -C $REPO deploy:trends`, then `git -C $REPO push origin main`).
  If it looks like expired credentials, suggest `wrangler login`.
- Push fails → the site is already live; report that only
  `git -C $REPO push origin main` needs re-running.

### 5. Report

Reply with 2-3 sentences: today's main takeaway, anything unusual (failed
sources, bootstrap notice), the published URL (https://trends.kkhys.me/),
and the commit hash.

## Feedback → profile updates (the secretary loop)

When the user reacts to a digest ("Rustは興味ない", "この記事良かった",
"はてなの総合カテゴリも見たい"), update the state files immediately:

- `profile.md` — move themes between high/mid/low, add new themes, extend
  除外テーマ. Generalize: "この記事不要" usually means a theme, not one URL.
  Append a dated entry to フィードバックログ recording feedback → change.
- `config.json` — hatena_categories, items_per_service, disabled_sources,
  site_repo.

Prefer small durable adjustments over drastic rewrites; the log exists so
changes remain traceable and reversible.

## Setup and troubleshooting

Optional `QIITA_ACCESS_TOKEN` (rate-limit headroom) and notes on future
X/Grok integration: `references/setup.md`. Scoring details and tuning:
`references/scoring.md`.
