Forms are tricky. They are one of the most common things you'll build in a web application, but also one of the most complex.

Well-designed HTML forms are:

- Well-structured and semantically correct.
- Easy to use and navigate (keyboard).
- Accessible with ARIA attributes and proper labels.
- Has support for client and server side validation.
- Well-styled and consistent with the rest of the application.

In this guide, we will take a look at building forms with [`react-hook-form`](https://react-hook-form.com) and [`zod`](https://zod.dev). We're going to use a `<FormField>` component to compose accessible forms using Radix UI components.

## Features

The `<Form />` component is a wrapper around the `react-hook-form` library. It provides a few things:

- Composable components for building forms.
- A `<FormField />` component for building controlled form fields.
- Form validation using `zod`.
- Handles accessibility and error messages.
- Uses `React.useId()` for generating unique IDs.
- Applies the correct `aria` attributes to form fields based on states.
- Built to work with all Radix UI components.
- Bring your own schema library. We use `zod` but you can use anything you want.
- **You have full control over the markup and styling.**

## Anatomy

```tsx
import { Form, FormControl, FormDescription, FormField, FormItem, FormLabel, FormMessage } from '#/ui/data-entry';

export default () => (
  <Form>
    <FormField
      control='...'
      name='...'
      render={() => (
        <FormItem>
          <FormLabel />
          <FormControl />
          <FormDescription />
          <FormMessage />
        </FormItem>
      )}
    />
  </Form>
);
```

## Usage

### 1. Create a form schema

Define the shape of your form using a Zod schema. You can read more about using Zod in the [Zod documentation](https://zod.dev).

```tsx
'use client';

import * as z from 'zod';

const formSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2).max(50),
});
```

### 2. Define a form

Use the `useForm` hook from `react-hook-form` to create a form.

```tsx
'use client';

import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import * as z from 'zod';

const formSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2, {
    message: 'Username must be at least 2 characters.',
  }),
});

export const ProfileForm = () => {
  // 1. Define your form.
  const form = useForm<z.infer<typeof formSchema>>({
    resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
    defaultValues: {
      username: '',
    },
  });

  // 2. Define a submit handler.
  const onSubmit = (values: z.infer<typeof formSchema>) => {
    // Do something with the form values.
    // ✅ This will be type-safe and validated.
    console.log(values);
  };
};
```

Since `FormField` is using a controlled component, you need to provide a default value for the field. See the [React Hook Form docs](https://react-hook-form.com/docs/usecontroller) to learn more about controlled components.

### 3. Build your form

We can now use the `<Form />` components to build our form.

```tsx
'use client';

import { zodResolver } from '@hookform/resolvers/zod';
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
import * as z from 'zod';

import { Button } from '@kkhys/ui';

import {
  Form,
  FormControl,
  FormDescription,
  FormField,
  FormItem,
  FormLabel,
  FormMessage,
  Input,
} from '#/ui/data-entry';

const formSchema = z.object({
  username: z.string().min(2, {
    message: 'Username must be at least 2 characters.',
  }),
});

export const ProfileForm = () => {
  // ...

  return (
    <Form {...form}>
      <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className='space-y-8'>
        <FormField
          control={form.control}
          name='username'
          render={({ field }) => (
            <FormItem>
              <FormLabel>Username</FormLabel>
              <FormControl>
                <Input placeholder='shadcn' {...field} />
              </FormControl>
              <FormDescription>This is your public display name.</FormDescription>
              <FormMessage />
            </FormItem>
          )}
        />
        <Button type='submit'>Submit</Button>
      </form>
    </Form>
  );
};
```

### 4. Done

That's it. You now have a fully accessible form that is type-safe with client-side validation.

<Canvas of={FormStories.Default} layout='fullscreen' />
